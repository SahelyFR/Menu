# Menu

## Goal
This little project is created to auto-generate a menu, for a complete week or selected days, depending on recipe's season.

## How-to
### Use the script on your side
You can use [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fhdx95YJpTuFtM0gy_oX2BLcXxQ_qQsDS4q5dKjrElM/edit?usp=sharing) as template to add your recipes and make them available for this script.  
Once you've duplicated the above template sheet, you can fill it with your own recipes, with link to instructions, picture and the suitable season.  
:warning: Think to update attached script with the one contained in this repository. :warning: (instructions below)

### Copy this repository's code to your own Google sheet
The easiest way, if you just want to use it is to simply copy/paste code contained in Code.js and Front.html in the equivalent files of the template sheet you've duplicated on your side.  
To do so, when on the template sheet, go to the "Extensions > Apps Scripts" menu item.

### For those of you who may want to update the script
You can use your loved IDE to develop with Apps Scripts. You will just need to install CLASP (Apps Script CLI) on your terminal.  
Everything is then summarized and explained on [Google Apps Script documentation](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp)
